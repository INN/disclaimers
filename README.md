Display disclaimers for posts or your whole site using a handy widget.

## Description ##

This plugin implements a widget allowing you to display disclaimers. Disclaimers can be set on a site-wide basis or on a per-post basis, with per-post disclaimers overriding site-wide disclaimers.

This plugin derives from work done on the [Largo theme for WordPress](https://largo.inn.org/). We've taken a small portion of Largo's functionality and made it accessible to all WordPress sites.

## Installation ##

### Manual Installation ###

1. Upload the entire `/disclaimers` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Disclaimers through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
